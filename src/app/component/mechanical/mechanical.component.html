            <h2 class="abt"> ABOUT  THE  DEPARTMENT</h2>
            <p>Pragati Engineering College started an undergraduate (B.Tech.) program in Mechanical Engineering in the
                year 2004, in order to<br> meet the educational needs of the K.G. basin. The Department of Mechanical
                Engineering
                caters to the regional and global<br> human resource requirements. The students of this department stood
                as
                college toppers in academics. The institution is located in<br> the industrial corridor and therefore
                the
                students and teachers of the department get benefited through Industry-Institute-<br>Interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department is committed to strengthen the academic, research and functional abilities of the
                students, in order to enable <br>them to stand as competent and versatile professionals after
                graduation.
                The department strives to enhance research activity in<br> the department, thereby creating competent
                intellectual resources to the students.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department building occupies an area of 27,500 SFT and houses well-equipped laboratories. The
                department conducts <br>various events for revealing scientific, engineering, and technological advances
                to
                students. The students participate in events and <br>national level contests, conducted by various
                institutes. The members of faculty have completed sponsored research projects,<br> amounting to a net
                worth
                of Rs. 21 lakhs, during the past three years.
